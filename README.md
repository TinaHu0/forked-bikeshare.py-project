## Porject Overview
This is a project to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
The data files are 'chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washington.csv' which are provided by Motivate, a bike system provider fro many major cites in the United States.
In this project we will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics.

## Data sets
Data are provided for the first half of 2017 for three cities. All three data files contain the same core six columns:
    Start Time
    End Time
    Trip Time
    Start Station
    End Station
    User Type
While in Chicago and New York City files there are two extra columns:
    Gender
    Birth Year   
    
## Question
    1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
        most common month
        most common day of week
        most common hour of day
    
    2 Popular stations and trip
        most common start station
        most common end station
        most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

    3 Trip duration
        total travel time
        average travel time

    4 User info
        counts of each user type
        counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
        earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
